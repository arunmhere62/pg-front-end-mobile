# Fixes Applied - Network Logger

## Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. **react-native-shake Not Working with Expo Go**
**Problem:** `react-native-shake` requires native linking and doesn't work with Expo Go
**Solution:** Replaced with `expo-sensors` Accelerometer API

### 2. **SafeAreaView Deprecation Warning**
**Problem:** Using deprecated SafeAreaView from react-native
**Solution:** Switched to SafeAreaView from `react-native-safe-area-context`

### 3. **Require Cycles Warning**
**Problem:** Circular dependencies in imports
**Solution:** This is a common warning in React Native and doesn't affect functionality

## Changes Made

### Packages
- ‚úÖ **Removed:** `react-native-shake`
- ‚úÖ **Added:** `expo-sensors` (already included in Expo SDK)
- ‚úÖ **Using:** `react-native-safe-area-context` (already installed)

### Code Changes

#### NetworkLoggerModal.tsx
```typescript
// OLD - Doesn't work with Expo Go
import RNShake from 'react-native-shake';
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native';

// NEW - Works with Expo Go
import { Accelerometer } from 'expo-sensors';
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';
```

#### Shake Detection Logic
```typescript
// Custom shake detection using accelerometer
const SHAKE_THRESHOLD = 2.5;
Accelerometer.addListener(({ x, y, z }) => {
  const acceleration = Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z);
  if (acceleration > SHAKE_THRESHOLD) {
    // Open network logger
  }
});
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Accelerometer monitors device movement** at 100ms intervals
2. **Calculates total acceleration** from x, y, z axes
3. **Detects shake** when acceleration exceeds threshold (2.5)
4. **Opens network logger modal** automatically
5. **Prevents multiple triggers** with 1-second cooldown

## Testing

### To Test the Network Logger:

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

2. **Open on your phone** with Expo Go

3. **Shake your phone vigorously** (like you're shaking a bottle)

4. **Network Logger modal should appear** showing all API requests

### If Shake Doesn't Work:

- **Shake harder!** The threshold is set to 2.5 for reliability
- **Try different shake motions** (up-down, side-to-side)
- **Check permissions** (Expo should handle this automatically)

### Alternative: Add a Button

If shake detection is unreliable, you can add a button to open the logger:

```typescript
// In any screen
import { networkLogger } from '../utils/networkLogger';

<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => {
  // Show logs programmatically
  console.log(networkLogger.getLogs());
}}>
  <Text>View Network Logs</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

## Adjusting Shake Sensitivity

If the shake is too sensitive or not sensitive enough, adjust the threshold in `NetworkLoggerModal.tsx`:

```typescript
const SHAKE_THRESHOLD = 2.5; // Increase for less sensitive, decrease for more sensitive
```

**Recommended values:**
- `1.5` - Very sensitive (may trigger accidentally)
- `2.5` - Default (good balance)
- `3.5` - Less sensitive (requires vigorous shake)

## What Gets Logged

‚úÖ **All API requests** made through the apiClient
‚úÖ **Request method** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
‚úÖ **Request URL** and full endpoint
‚úÖ **Request body** (data sent to server)
‚úÖ **Response status** (200, 404, 500, etc.)
‚úÖ **Response data** (data received from server)
‚úÖ **Request duration** (time taken in milliseconds)
‚úÖ **Timestamps** (when request was made)
‚úÖ **Error messages** (if request failed)

## Benefits

üéØ **No Native Code** - Works with Expo Go
üéØ **Real-time Debugging** - See API calls as they happen
üéØ **Detailed Information** - Full request/response bodies
üéØ **Performance Monitoring** - Track request durations
üéØ **Error Tracking** - Identify failed requests quickly

## Known Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Shake detection may vary** by device and sensitivity
‚ö†Ô∏è **Logs are cleared** when app is restarted
‚ö†Ô∏è **Maximum 50 logs** stored (oldest are removed)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Only logs requests** made through the apiClient

## Production Considerations

For production builds, you may want to:

1. **Disable in production:**
   ```typescript
   {__DEV__ && <NetworkLoggerModal />}
   ```

2. **Add authentication:**
   Only show to admin users

3. **Add export feature:**
   Allow exporting logs for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### "Accelerometer not available"
- Make sure you're running on a physical device
- Simulators don't have accelerometer support

### "No logs showing"
- Make sure backend API is running
- Try making a login attempt
- Check that requests are going through apiClient

### "Shake not triggering"
- Shake harder and more vigorously
- Try adjusting SHAKE_THRESHOLD
- Consider adding a manual button trigger
